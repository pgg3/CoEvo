        "raw_content": "## Ideas\n- **Idea 1: Environmental Stress Factor**\n  - **Reasoning:** Bacterial growth can be negatively impacted when environmental parameters (like temperature and pH) deviate from their optimal values. An exponential function can model this effect, which means the farther away from optimal conditions, the more pronounced the negative effect.\n  - **Definition:** Introduce an environmental stress factor that reduces growth rate based on the deviation from optimal temperature (37\u00b0C for E. Coli) and pH (around 7).\n\n- **Idea 2: Synergistic Environmental Effects**\n  - **Reasoning:** The growth rate can be significantly influenced by simultaneous favorable conditions. For example, combinations of high substrate concentration and optimal temperature lead to improved growth rates.\n  - **Definition:** Create interaction terms between different environmental factors (e.g., substrate concentration and temperature) to enhance or reduce the growth rate depending on the combination of conditions.\n\n- **Idea 3: Metabolic Adjustment Response**\n  - **Reasoning:** The metabolic activity of bacteria is closely tied to temperature and pH levels. An optimal condition enhances growth; hence, using a Gaussian function can model the enhancement or reduction of growth rates due to metabolic adjustments at various temperatures and pH levels.\n  - **Definition:** Combine effects of temperature and pH using exponential decay functions to adjust the growth rate based on proximity to the optimal conditions.\n\n## Thoughts\nTo model E.
